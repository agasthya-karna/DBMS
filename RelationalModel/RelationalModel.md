# Relational Model

The relational model can be visualized as a structured table comprising rows and columns. 

## Key Components

- **Tuple**: Each row in this table is referred to as a tuple.
- **Attribute**: Every column within the table is identified by a specific name or attribute.

## Domain

The domain refers to a distinct set of fundamental values that a particular attribute can possess. For any given attribute, denoted as **A<sub>i</sub>**, there exists a specific domain, represented as **dom(A<sub>i</sub>)**.

## Relational Instance

A relational instance in a database system is essentially a limited collection of tuples. It's important to note that relational instances do not contain any duplicate tuples.

## Relational Schema

A relational schema provides a blueprint for the relational database. It encompasses:
- The name of the relation
- The names of all its associated columns or attributes

## Relational Key

A relational key is a unique identifier within the relational database. It consists of one or multiple attributes that collectively enable the unique identification of each row within a relation.
